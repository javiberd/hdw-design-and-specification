# Hardware design and specification with VHDL
This repository contains all the work done throughout the extension of the course Diseño Automático de Sistemas taken at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and imparted by José M. Mendías. Ten assignments and my final project are included.

## Explanation of each of the directories
- /common: contains components used for a variety of assignments
- /lab1 to /lab10: assignments. Each directory contains .vhdl files, .bit bitstream file, and a .pdf with what had to be done.
- /project: project developed at the end of the course. A platforms game was elaborated.
