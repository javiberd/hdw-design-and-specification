# Hardware design and specification with VHDL
This repository contains all the work done throughout the extension of the course ["Diseño Automático de Sistemas"](http://www.fdi.ucm.es/profesor/mendias/DAS/DAS.html) taken at Universidad Complutense de Madrid. This course was imparted by José M. Mendías. 

During the course we learned and applied some of the methodologies of digital circuit design based on EDA tools. Ten assignments and my final project were developed, all of them in VHDL. All work was tested on a FPGA (Spartan-3-XC3S1000).

## Explanation of each of the directories
- /common: contains components used for a variety of assignments
- /lab1 to /lab10: assignments. Each directory contains .vhdl files, .bit bitstream file, and a .pdf with what had to be done.
- /project: project developed at the end of the course. A platforms game was elaborated.
